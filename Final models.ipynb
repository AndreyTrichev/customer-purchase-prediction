Подробное описание и анализ экспериментов\n","\n","#### 0. Baseline (Logistic Regression)\n","**Цель:** Создать отправную точку для сравнения. Была построена модель логистической регрессии. С помощью `GridSearchCV` оптимально подобраны сила (C) и тип (L1) регуляризации, а также стратегия балансировки классов.\n","\n","Модель показала **ROC AUC = 0.870**, подтвердив наличие линейных зависимостей в данных. Высокий `Recall` (0.731) при низком `Precision` (0.408) говорит о том, что модель хорошо находит целевых клиентов, но ценой большого количества ложноположительных срабатываний — приемлемый компромисс для недорогих маркетинговых кампаний.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 1. Feature Engineering\n","*   **Цель:** Обогатить данные и проверить гипотезы о поведении клиентов. В датасет были добавлены новые признаки, отражающие бизнес-логику:\n","    *   *Мультиканальность*: `ChannelCount` и флаг `IsMultichannel`.\n","    *   *Агрегированные показатели*: `TotalMnt`, `TotalPurchases`, `AvgPurchaseValue`.\n","    *   *Социально-демографический флаг*: `IsParent`.\n","\n","**Этот шаг дал самый значительный и \"дешёвый\" прирост качества**. Метрика **PR AUC**, наиболее чувствительная к улучшениям в условиях дисбаланса, выросла **с 0.573 до 0.663 (+15.7%)**. Это доказывает, что сгенерированные признаки несут в себе ценную бизнес-информацию, которую модель смогла успешно использовать для более точного разделения классов.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 2. Feature Selection\n","**Цель:** Удалить избыточные и \"шумные\" признаки для повышения стабильности модели. Применён двухэтапный отбор: сначала **корреляционный фильтр** удалил 3 признака с `|ρ| > 0.9`, затем **RFECV** (рекурсивное исключение признаков) оставил 23 наиболее сильных предиктора.\n","\n","Отбор признаков привел к дальнейшему росту **ROC AUC до 0.889**. `Recall` значительно вырос до **0.836**: удаление \"шума\" позволило модели стать более чувствительной и увереннее находить представителей целевого класса, не теряя при этом в точности.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 3. Смена модели на ансамбли\n","**Цель:** Проверить, смогут ли более сложные нелинейные модели превзойти логистическую регрессию.\n","\n","На лучшем наборе из 23 признаков были обучены и настроены три топовых ансамблевых алгоритма. Все три ансамбля значительно превзошли линейную модель, значит в данных есть нелинейные зависимости. `HistGradientBoosting` и `RandomForest` показали очень схожие и высокие результаты (ROC AUC ~0.90), существенно повысив `Precision` до ~0.53.\n","\n","**LightGBM** оказался лидером, достигнув **ROC AUC 0.907** и **PR AUC 0.684**. Эта модель нашла наилучший баланс между охватом (Recall 0.776) и точностью.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Ключевые факторы роста качества\n","\n","1.  **Инженерия признаков:** Добавление бизнес-метрик (`IsMultichannel`, `AvgPurchaseValue`) дало главный рывок в качестве (**+0.090 PR-AUC**).\n","2.  **Переход к градиентному бустингу:** Смена линейной модели на ансамблевую позволила учесть нелинейные зависимости и дала следующий по значимости прирост (**+0.018 ROC-AUC** к лучшему результату логистической регрссии).\n","3.  **Отбор признаков** улучшил `Recall`, сделав модель более надежной, хотя прирост по основным метрикам небольшой.\n","\n","> **Итог:** Максимальное качество было достигнуто за счет синергии трех подходов: **продуманной инженерии признаков**, **тщательного отбора** и **использования алгоритма LightGBM**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Важнейшие признаки в финальной модели (LightGBM, top-10 по gain)\n","\n","1.  `NumWebVisitsMonth`\n","2.  `Recency`\n","3.  `ChannelCount`\n","4.  `NumCatalogPurchases`\n","5.  `Income`\n","6.  `TotalPurchases`\n","7.  `MntWines`\n","8.  `IsParent`\n","9.  `Education_PhD`\n","10. `AvgPurchaseValue`\n","\n","**Анализ:** Сгенерированные нами признаки `ChannelCount`, `TotalPurchases`, `IsParent` и `AvgPurchaseValue` вошли в топ-10, подтвердив свою высокую предсказательную силу. В частности, `ChannelCount` в топ-3 доказывает, что гипотеза о важности мультиканальности была верна.\n","\n","\n","### 6. Заключение и рекомендации\n","\n","Финальная модель на основе **LightGBM**, обученная на расширенном и очищенном наборе признаков, является оптимальным решением и гарантирует лучший баланс метрик:\n","*   **Высокий охват** (Recall ~ 78%), позволяющий не упустить большинство потенциальных клиентов.\n","*   **Приемлемую точность** (Precision ~ 49%), делающую кампанию экономически эффективной.\n","*   **Максимальные интегральные метрики** (ROC AUC = 0.907, PR AUC = 0.684), подтверждающие способность хорошо разделять покупателей на классы.\n","\n","**Рекомендуется** использовать именно эту модель для таргетирования в будущей маркетинговой кампании. Признак мультиканальности клиента следует рассматривать как один из ключевых флагов для сегментации \"тёплой\" аудитории."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
